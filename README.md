> ## SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, AND TECHNOLOGY ARE NOT MERELY CAREERS—THEY ARE THE DYNAMIC FORCES THAT SHAPE CIVILIZATION. HISTORY’S MOST SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGHS HAVE NOT EMERGED SOLELY FROM THEORIES OR TEXTBOOKS; THEY HAVE BEEN FORGED IN THE CRUCIBLE OF BOLD IDEAS, RELENTLESS INNOVATION, AND DECISIVE ACTION. AS AN ENGINEER, YOUR POTENTIAL IS BOUNDLESS—LIMITED ONLY BY THE SCALE OF YOUR VISION AND THE COURAGE TO ACT. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK BOLDLY, PUSH BOUNDARIES, AND CHALLENGE LIMITS; WHEN DETERMINATION MEETS INGENUITY, NO OBSTACLE IS INSURMOUNTABLE.
